# Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the GPT-4 source code. It is intended to help developers understand the structure and functionality of the code, and to provide guidance on how to use and modify it.

## Source Code Overview

The GPT-4 source code is organized into several sections, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the AI's functionality. Here is a brief overview of what you can find in each section:

1. `src/index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the GPT-4 website. It provides the structure for the website and includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. `src/css/style.css`: This file contains the CSS code that styles the GPT-4 website. It includes styles for the layout, typography, colors, and other visual elements of the website.

3. `src/js/main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file for the GPT-4 website. It includes the code that controls the website's interactivity and functionality.

4. `src/js/user.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code related to user interactions, such as logging in and out, registering, and managing user profiles.

5. `src/js/analytics.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for tracking and analyzing user interactions on the GPT-4 website.

6. `server/server.js`: This is the main server file. It sets up the server, handles requests and responses, and manages the interaction between the website and the GPT-4 API.
