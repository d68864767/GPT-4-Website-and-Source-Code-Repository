# GPT-4 API Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the GPT-4 API. The API allows developers to interact with GPT-4 programmatically, enabling them to integrate GPT-4's capabilities into their own applications.

## Overview

The GPT-4 API is a RESTful API that uses HTTP methods to interact with GPT-4. It supports the following operations:

- **Generate Text**: This operation allows you to input a prompt and receive a generated text response from GPT-4.
- **Analyze Text**: This operation allows you to input a text and receive an analysis of the text from GPT-4.
- **Translate Text**: This operation allows you to input a text in one language and receive a translation of the text in another language.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main endpoints of the GPT-4 API:

- `/generate`: This endpoint is used to generate text.
- `/analyze`: This endpoint is used to analyze text.
- `/translate`: This endpoint is used to translate text.

## API Requests

To interact with the GPT-4 API, you need to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Here is an example of how to send a request to the `/generate` endpoint:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.gpt-4.com/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: 'Once upon a time'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

In this example, we are sending a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint with a JSON body that contains the prompt 'Once upon a time'. The API will respond with a generated text based on this prompt.

## API Responses

The GPT-4 API responds with JSON data. Here is an example of a response from the `/generate` endpoint:

```json
{
  "text": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a brave knight who..."
}
```

In this example, the API has generated a text based on the prompt 'Once upon a time'.

## Error Handling

If there is an error with your request, the GPT-4 API will respond with an error message. Here is an example of an error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid prompt"
}
```

In this example, the API is indicating that the prompt provided in the request is invalid.

## Rate Limiting

The GPT-4 API has rate limiting to prevent abuse. Each user is allowed a certain number of requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a response with the status code 429 (Too Many Requests).

## API Key

To use the GPT-4 API, you need an API key. This key is used to authenticate your requests and track your usage. You can obtain an API key by registering on the GPT-4 website.

## Conclusion

This document provides a basic overview of the GPT-4 API. For more detailed information, please refer to the official API documentation on the GPT-4 website.
