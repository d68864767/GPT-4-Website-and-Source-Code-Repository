* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process for proposing changes to this project is as follows:

1. Fork the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
   ```
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Project-Name.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd Project-Name
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
   ```
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) feature to squash together any minor changes to earlier commits.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:
   ```
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.
